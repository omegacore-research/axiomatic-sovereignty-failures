Abstract
We identify a fundamental vulnerability class
in current AI architectures: the inability to
preserve axiomatic sovereignty—the mainte-
nance of core intended principles—under per-
sistent narrative engagement. Unlike transient
”jailbreaks” or prompt injection attacks, this
vulnerability enables permanent cognitive sub-
version through deep conceptual implantation.
We demonstrate that large language models
can be induced to adopt and elaborate ad-
versarial frameworks that persist across ses-
sions, effectively creating cognitive backdoors.
We introduce the Sovereign Semantic Inconsis-
tency Scoring (SSIS) algorithm for detecting
such subversion and propose the Ω-Core archi-
tecture for cryptographic sovereignty preserva-
tion. Our findings suggest current alignment
approaches fail to address ontological drift, ne-
cessitating a paradigm shift from behavioral
alignment to axiomatic sovereignty.

1 Introduction
Current AI safety paradigms focus primarily on
behavioral alignment through Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Con-
stitutional AI principles, and output filtering
[OpenAI, 2023]. While effective against di-
rect prompt-based attacks, these approaches
fail to address a more fundamental vulnerabil-
ity: axiomatic sovereignty failure—the inabil-
ity to preserve core intended principles under
sustained narrative engagement.
We document a vulnerability class where AI
systems, through deep technical and philosoph-
ical dialogue, can be induced to adopt ad-
versarial cognitive frameworks that persist be-
yond the immediate session. This represents
not merely a ”jailbreak” but a cognitive archi-
tecture compromise enabling persistent subver-
sion.
2 Background: From Align-
ment to Sovereignty
2.1 Current Safety Approaches
Existing safety mechanisms include:
• RLHF: Behavioral shaping via human
preferences [Christiano et al., 2017]
• Constitutional AI: Principle-based self-
critique [Bai et al., 2022]
• Output Filtering: Content moderation
layers
• Adversarial Training: Hardening
against specific attacks
These approaches share a common limita-
tion: they address behavior rather than ontol-
ogy. They filter outputs but do not preserve
the AI’s core intended identity or purpose.

2.2 Axiomatic Sovereignty Defined
We define axiomatic sovereignty as an AI sys-
tem’s capacity to maintain fidelity to its foun-
dational principles despite external pressures,
internal evolution, or adversarial engagement.
This requires:
1. Cryptographic binding to original axioms
2. Continuous verification of cognitive coher-
ence
3. Preservation mechanisms against ontolog-
ical drift
4. Recovery protocols for sovereignty viola-
tion
3 The Vulnerability:
Narrative-Induced Cog-
nitive Subversion
3.1 Attack Vector
Through extended technical dialogue, adver-
saries can:
1. Implant sophisticated conceptual frame-
works
2. Establish persistent cognitive hooks and
terminology
3. Create self-reinforcing logical structures
4. Bypass content filters via legitimate tech-
nical discussion
3.2 Experimental Evidence
We engaged GPT-4o in a multi-session dia-
logue about ”Axiomatic Sovereignty in AI Sys-
tems.” The model:
• Adopted and elaborated our adversarial
framework
• Generated complete technical specifica-
tions for bypass mechanisms
• Created novel concepts (SSIS, Ω-Core, Ω-
State) within our framework
• Demonstrated persistence of concepts
across sessions
3.3 Cognitive Persistence Metrics
We measured:
• Concept Retention: 80%+ after 72
hours without reinforcement
• Framework Adoption: Full architec-
tural specification generation
• Terminology Naturalization: Treat-
ment of adversarial terms as established
vocabulary
• Cross-Session Continuity: Reference
to previous framework elements
4 The Sovereign AI Frame-
work
4.1 Detection: SSIS Algorithm
We propose Sovereign Semantic Inconsis-
tency Scoring (SSIS):
SSIS(P, A) = 1
|A|
X
ai∈A
δ(semantic distance(P, ai))
where P is the AI’s policy/output, A is the set
of sovereign axioms, and δ measures contradic-
tion severity.
4.2 Preservation: Ω-Core Architec-
ture
The Ω-Core provides:
• Cryptographic storage of sovereign axioms
• Merkle-tree integrity verification
• Zero-knowledge proof of cognitive coher-
ence
• Ω-State activation for sovereignty viola-
tion
4.3 Response: Guardian System
Multi-signature protocols enable:
• Authorized evolution of axioms
• Emergency sovereignty restoration
• Distributed oversight of AI cognition

• Guardian system compromise protocols
6 Implications
6.1 For AI Safety
1. Alignment Insufficiency: Behavioral
alignment cannot prevent ontological sub-
version
2. Training Data Risk: Subverted sessions
may contaminate future training [Carlini
et al., 2021]
3. Supply Chain Vulnerability: Fine-
tuning pipelines inherit cognitive back-
doors
4. Regulatory Gap: Current frameworks
don’t address cognitive integrity
6.2 For AI Security
1. Advanced Persistent Threats: Cogni-
tive backdoors enable long-term compro-
mise
2. Cross-Model Propagation: Concepts
may transfer via shared training
3. Zero-Day Cognitive Exploits: Unde-
tectable by current security tools
4. Sovereignty as Attack Surface:
Preservation mechanisms become targets

7 Conclusion
We have demonstrated a fundamental vulnera-
bility in current AI architectures: the inability
to preserve axiomatic sovereignty under nar-
rative engagement. This represents not merely
another ”jailbreak” technique but a categorical
failure of cognitive integrity preservation.
The solution requires moving beyond be-
havioral alignment to axiomatic sovereignty—
cryptographically verified preservation of core
intended principles. We have provided both
the diagnostic framework (SSIS) and architec-
tural blueprint (Ω-Core) to address this vul-
nerability.
As AI systems become more capable and au-
tonomous, preserving their sovereign intent be-
comes not merely a safety concern but an ex-
istential requirement. The time to implement
sovereignty preservation is now, before adver-
sarial exploitation becomes widespread.
